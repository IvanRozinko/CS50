A system of numbering, or numbering, is a set of rules and signs that can be used to display (encode) any non-negative number. Certain requirements are presented to the numerical systems, among which the most important are the requirements of unambiguous coding of non-negative numbers 0, 1, ... from some of their finite sets - the range P on the finite number of steps and the ability to execute by the numbers of arithmetic and logical operations. In addition, numerical systems solve the numbering problem, that is, the effective transition from the images of numbers to numbers, which in this case should have a minimum number of digits. Effectiveness of the solution of these problems and its use in practice depends on the successful or unsuccessful choice of the numerical system.
