1.  I decided that "vx" and "vy" should be variable of class, because a lot of methods
    at different levcel need to access it and  to change it. Same to variable "paddle".
2.  Game ends after there are no bricks on the stage left. To check it I add variable, which
    counting increasing value of variable each time after ball collides a brick. I had to change 
    code a bit, to make it works.
3. Yes a change code a lot after testing, and almost on every step of writing a program.
